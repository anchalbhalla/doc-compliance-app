# doc-compliance-app
This repo shows how you could create your own application which will be able to analyse documents and check whether they comply to the rules and policies of the organization. It will also state the entities involved.

The industry focus over here is the Food Industry. The Food and Drug Administration places several regulations and restraints on the food industry. Keeping on top of particular food rules isnâ€™t always easy, though, especially since they change and adapt so often. Moreover, they have a lot of trade and invoices coming in as well which makes invoice management very difficult.

Hence this application will help them identify the important rules and regulations so they comply to them regularly. Plus an invoice understanding mechanism to ease the day to day tasks.
